###PID COMPONENT
Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected?
In PID control we are trying to set steering angle in proportion of  cross track error (cte) which is the lateral difference between 

Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.

### Hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients)

Student discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!
